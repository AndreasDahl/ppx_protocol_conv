Ppx for generating serialization and de-serialization of ocaml types.

Ppx_protocol_conv generates code to serialize and de-serialize
types. The ppx itself does not contain any protocol specific code,
but relies on 'drivers' that defines serialization and
de-serialisation of basic types and structures.

Pre-defined drivers are available in seperate packages:
ppx_protocol_conf_json (Yojson.Safe.json)
ppx_protocol_conf_msgpack (Xml.xml)
ppx_protocol_conf_xml-light (Msgpck.t)
